    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This project seeks to improve the analysis of student feedback in courses at the
  University of Minnesota, focusing on popular COmputer Science classes to start. Teaching quality significantly impacts student learning and 
  by gathering data from surveys and augmenting it with sentiment-based public reviews, we aim to uncover actionable insights 
  through advanced NLP techniques. Using models like BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, we will perform sentiment analysis and 
  apply clustering techniques to capture common themes in the feedback given. Our goal is to identify critical factors beyond course content 
  that influence student satisfaction and engagement, ultimately offering data-driven recommendations to enhance teaching practices 
  and course design.</p>

<p>This figure, taken from the paper written by Sujata Rani and Parteek Kumar (which was the initial inspiration behind the project), shows the basic process that we plan on using. Although our
  feedback data will come from different sources and our results will be presented differently, this is the underlying structure of the project.

<h2 id="midterm">Midterm OH Progress</h2>

<p>
<b>Progress</b>
</p>
<p>
We decided to  slightly update our project so that we're not only focusing on
introductory CS courses. In our initial project, we mentioned focusing on these
base-level courses to improve them, but the overall goal of the project is to be
able to use it on any class/professor to provide useful and actionable feedback,
so we decided to start with classes that we're in. This will help us build the model,
whoch can then be adapted for all kinds of courses.
<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Questions</b>
</p>

<p>
The RateMyProfessor Code of Conduct does mention that web "scraping" isn't
allowed (without prior permission anyways). Is it ok to use it for this project?
<p>
Is there any way to access SRS data from the University for the classes that
we're focusing on?
<p>
Are we allowed to use code that was already constructed for some parts of our project?
For example, there is some code online for the RateMyProfessor web scraping. Could we repurpose
that, with attribution, to take care of that part of the data collection?
</p>

<p>
<b>Plan for the Future</b>
</p>
  
<p>
Step 1: Complete Data Collection & Cleaning. Based off of the answers that we get from OH
about the SRS data and using RMP, we'll clean up the data to make it easy for the
sentiment analysis model to read and use it. This will include making sure the class
name, professor, and feedback is listed for each class. For different platforms, we'll also focus
on different things (like RMP provides some other measures including difficulty), which the SRS may label
differently or not have at all. Our survey was designed to align with these different measures
as closely as possible.
(Done by: Nov. 11)
<p>
Step 2: Create Sentiment Analysis Model. Using the different pre-trained BERT models that we mentioned,
we want to create the best possible sentiment analysis model. We will also need to implement clustering, again
by testing out different clustering methods and finding which is best, to clump together
common themes in the feedback that's given by students. We'll focus on the sentiment analysis first
to see what themes can be pulled from that, then implement the clustering to look for specific words.
(Done by: Nov. 20)
<p>
Step 3: Visualize using Graphical Representations. Once we finalize the sentiment analysis model and clustering,
we want to focus on how we will visualize it. We have some intial ideas, including graphs and word clouds,
so we will start here. However, since the point of the project is to help professors understand the feedback that they're given
and implement it, we will present the visualizations to different professors to see how it can be improved.
We then need to implement the given feedback for our finalized visualizations.
(Done by: Nov. 27)
<p>
Step 4: Final Poster & Project Report. Our overall goal is to complete the project by Thanksgiving break. Then we can
use the break to create the poster and start the report, and finish up the report once our final
presentation is complete.
(Done by: Dec. 3 & Dec. 12)
